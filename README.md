1. Reading-specific goal tracking that traditional calendars don't offer - tracking pages read, books completed, or reading streaks

2. Integration with reading platforms like Goodreads, Kindle, or Apple Books to automatically import your current reads and progress

3. Smart scheduling features that help you fit reading into your day based on book length, reading speed, and completion goals

4. Community features that let you manage reading challenges or book clubs directly through the app

5. Reading analytics that show patterns in your reading habits, genres, and completion rates over time

This dedicated reading calendar creates a focused space for this specific activity that respects reading as an intentional practice rather than just another task to check off.
